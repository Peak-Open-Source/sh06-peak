To run the MongoDB file in Docker and store it in Docker, run the following commands:

line 1: docker run -t mongo 
line 2: docker images (just to check if mongo image is stored)
line 3: docker run mongodb 
line 4: docker ps (checks if the mongo is running in the container - should come up with information of container)
line 5: docker exec -it (containerID) (full directory of files from which we afer running the docker container (e.g /data/db))

After these, the terminal should take us into a test directory and by running the following command:

line 6: show collections 

shows all the JSOn information we have.

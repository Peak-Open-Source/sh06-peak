To run the MongoDB file in Docker and store it in Docker, run the following commands:

line 1: docker run -t mongo 
line 2: docker images (just to check if mongo image is stored)
line 3: docker run mongodb 
line 4: docker ps (checks if the mongo is running in the container - should come up with information of container)
line 5: docker exec -it (containerID) (full directory of files from which we afer running the docker container (e.g /data/db))

After these, the terminal should take us into a test directory and by running the following command:

line 6: show collections 

shows all the JSOn information we have.

OR:

line 1: docker run -t mongo
line 2: docker pull mongo:latest
line 3: docker run mongo

line4: make new directory (mkdir (newDirectory)

Inside the new directory

docker run -d -p 2717:27017 -v ~/data/db --name (mymongo) mongo

check if container is made by running (docker ps - should output a container ID)

line 5: winpty docker exec -it mymongo bash (should take us inside container.

line 6: run mongo in the container
Should take us into a local directory called test>

line 7: show dbs (will show all databases inside directory)

class UploadInformation(BaseModel):

    """
    A class used to represent the uploaded file contents of a
    PDB file that the user has chosen to edit/upload. This class
    can be used to control the corresponding server-side
    files for the uploaded PDB.

    Attributes
    ----------

    pdb_id : str

        The Protein Data Bank ID of the uploaded protein file. This is
        a unique identifier.

    sequence : str

        The protein structure sequence of the uploaded protein file.

    file_content : str

        The full text contents of the uploaded protein file. Stored so
        that the file can be dynamically recreated on the server even
        after restart.

    Methods
    -------

    clean() -> None:

        Destroys any existing folder that contains information with the
        same PDB ID.

    store() -> None:
    
        Creates a new .ent file containing the contents of the uploaded
        PDB file. If a corresponding folder for the PDB ID does not exist,
        one is created - otherwise, the existing folder is wiped before
        the new file is saved.
